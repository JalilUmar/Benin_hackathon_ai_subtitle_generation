00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:13.000 c
Ay, my Llorona,  Llorona of the blue sky

Ay, my Llorona, Llorona of the blue sky

00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000 c

00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:18.000 c
Llorona of the blue sky. And although life costs me Llorona, I will not stop loving you. Although life costs me Llorona, I will not stop loving you

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:34.000 c
I will not stop loving you, I will not stop loving you

Ay, ay, ay
